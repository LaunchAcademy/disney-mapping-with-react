Let's make a simple app that displays movies, and when we click on the name of a movie, we should be able to see the songs for that movie in an alert message.

## Getting Started

- The app has the `App.js` component and `MovieTile` component partially built
- A handleClick function has been defined. If given the argument of a movie, it will make an alert with that movies songs! 

## Goals

- Using the data from `/constants/data`, generate movie tiles for display
- Using the data from `/constants/data`, generate song tiles for display
- Use `.map()` to create lists of both `Movies` and `Songs`
- Use the existing `handleClick` function to filter through the songs that should be displayed for each movie when clicked
