## Goals

- Create a separation of concerns by breaking out the data we're given into components for display
- Use `.map()` to create lists of both `Movies` and `Songs`
- Create tiles to display the movies and the songs in the lists
- Use the existing `handleClick` function to filter through the songs that should be displayed for each movie
